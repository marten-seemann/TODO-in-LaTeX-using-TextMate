Does exactly the same as the original [TextMate TODO bundle](https://github.com/textmate/todo.tmbundle), instead of analyzing the (self defined) LaTeX commands *\todo{}*, *\todo\*{}*, *\fixme{}*, *\fixme\*{}*.

These commands are defined in the file [todo_fixme.sty](TODO-in-LaTeX-using-TextMate/blob/master/todo_fixme.sty).

Please refer to the INSTALL file for installation instructions. I know, following these steps it's a bit annoying, but I couldn't figure out an easier way. If you know how, please contact me!
